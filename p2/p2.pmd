# Introduction

We here present the interview that we conducted in the context of the project
assignment of the course Interdisciplinary Research Methodology for Information
Sciences (IS). This interview aims at investigating the perceived sense of
acceptance of a particular senior to Smart Home technologies.

The interviewee is the grandfather of the author, Lorenzo Di Nicola, age 92. He
lives at his own home with his wife Armida. The interview was conducted in
Italian.


# Interview Structure

We decided to open the interview with an introduction to the subject of elderly
home care and smart homes some easy questions. Later we started asking questions
that required more thinking on behalf of the interviewee, followed by another
series of easy questions to ease of any possible tension or stress. Following is
the list of questions that compose the interview:

#. Have you ever heard of Smart Homes?
#. How did you heard of it?
#. Do you know anyone who uses Smart Home technologies?
#. Do you know anyone of your age who's had injuries due to a fall?
#. What do you do to prevent that from happening to you?
#. Consider a wearable device that can detect a fall and alert someone. Evaluate
  it on a scale from 1 to 5 where 1 means "not at all useful" and 5 means "very
  useful".
#. Can you argument on that?
#. Evaluate the wearable device on a scale from 1 to 5 where 1 means "not at all
  intrusive" and 5 means "very intrusive".
#. Can you argument on that?
#. Consider a video monitoring device that can detect a fall and alert someone.
  Evaluate it on a scale from 1 to 5 where 1 means "not at all useful" and 5
  means "very useful".
#. Can you argument on that?
#. Evaluate the video monitoring device on a scale from 1 to 5 where 1 means
  "not at all intrusive" and 5 means "very intrusive".
#. Can you argument on that?
#. Consider the feature in both devices that allows someone to be alerted of a
  fall event. Evaluate it on a scale from 1 to 5 where 1 means "not at all
  useful" and 5 means "very useful".
#. Why do you think that?
#. To whom would you like the alert to be sent?
#. Do you have any additional remark?
#. Which color would you like a wearable device?

We then thanked the interviewee and declared the end of the interview. We want
to highlight that before introducing the wearable device and the video
monitoring device respectively, we made an introduction of the device to the
interviewee, trying to use simple vocabulary and with the help of some pictures
from the Internet.


# Analysis

This Section presents the coding protocol (in Section \ref{coding-protocol})
used to analyze the interview and the actual interview analysis of the conducted
interview (in Section \ref{interview-analysis}).


## Coding Protocol

To analyze the data gathered during the interview, we make use of a coding
protocol that defines a number of codes that will be used during the analysis to
assign a salient concept (represented by a word or a short sentence, a *code*)
to a portion of the interview or answer given by the interviewee. The codes used
have been selected from the concepts learned during the literature review and
some of the acceptance studies examined. They are summarized in the following
table:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Code**              **Meaning**
--------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------
*Invasive*            Signals that the technology the interviewee is
                      talking about is perceived as invasive. It may depend
                      on design aspect of a technology or the methodology
                      used.

*Uncomfortable*       Signals that the interviewee feels uncomfortable
                      about the technology. This might be because of the
                      way the technology operates or the way it is
                      perceived.

*Afraid/worried*      Signals that the technology perceives the technology
                      as worrying (for different reasons). What we mean
                      in this context is worries deriving from the use of
                      the technology (in the practical sense to "make it
                      work") and privacy concerns.
--------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------

These codes are used to highlight portions of the interview with and agreed-upon
concept label. These terms have been selected so to restrict the scope of the
analysis of phrases and passages to the relevant topic. We recall that the aim
of the interview is to discern personal feelings and perceived opinions of the
interviewee when comparing two different Smart Home solutions for fall
detection: a wearable device and a video monitoring system.
